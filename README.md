# LAB 6: CREATING CUSTOM TOOLS
Due: 1 May 2020

##  WHAT TO SUBMIT
You will submit a file to your Github repo via Moodle. You will need to create your own `.py` file for the repo. *Be sure it contains good comment headers!* Be sure your repo includes:
- `random_sample.py` 
- `Tools.tbx` file (saved in your Lab_6 results folder)

There is no README required for this lab. However, this repo - **more than any other** - is one you should dress up for a portfolio piece. It is a complete script, along with a custom toolbox: thatâ€™s something worth showing off with a good readme!
